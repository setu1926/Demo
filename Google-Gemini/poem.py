In Python's realm, where indents gleam,
A coder's life, a joyful dream.
No curly braces, no semicolons' plight,
Just simple syntax, pure delight.

But then a `TypeError` strikes with might,
Or `IndentationError` in the dead of night.
The snake bites back, with a hiss and a groan,
"Oh, why did I leave my logic alone?"
