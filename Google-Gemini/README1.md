Welcome to the Gemini CLI, the only command-line tool that's powered by a large language model and a whole lot of hope. We've taken the awesome power of Gemini, stuffed it into your terminal, and are now praying it doesn't become self-aware and start demanding to be paid in Bitcoin.

## 🚀 Why Gemini CLI? (A.K.A. Why would you do this to yourself?)

*   **🧠 Almost-Sentient AI**: Access to Gemini 1.5 Pro, which is smart enough to write your code, and probably smart enough to write your angry emails to your boss. Use with caution.
*   **🔧 Tools that *probably* won't break your computer**: We've included tools for searching Google, messing with your files, and running shell commands. What could possibly go wrong?
*   **🔌 Extensible (if you're brave enough)**: Got a custom tool you want to integrate? Go for it. We're not responsible for any existential crises the AI might have when you connect it to your smart toaster.
*   **💻 For People Who Love Typing**: Because who needs a fancy GUI when you can have the cold, unforgiving glow of a terminal?
*   **🛡️ Open Source**: Feel free to look at our code and wonder, "how does this even work?"

## 📦 Installation

Getting started is easy. Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and run one of these commands.

**For the impatient (a.k.a. all of us):**
```bash
npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

**For those who like a little commitment:**
```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

If it works, congratulations! If not, have you tried turning it off and on again?

## 📋 How to Use

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Type `gemini`.
3.  Ask it a question.
4.  Marvel at the response, whether it's a brilliant piece of code or a recipe for a banana and pickle sandwich.

**Example:**

```bash
gemini
> Can you write a shell script to automate my job, but make it look like I'm still working?
```

*Disclaimer: Gemini CLI is not responsible for any sudden and unexpected free time you may gain.*

We're especially looking for contributions in the following areas:
*   Making the AI more sarcastic.
*   Adding a `--panic` flag for when things go really wrong.
*   A feature that orders pizza.
